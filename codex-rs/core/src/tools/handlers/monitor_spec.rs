                - Batch processors that emit per-item output — restart would re-process items\n\n\

        description: r#"Spawn a background shell command. Each output line is streamed to the user's view in real time; on termination you receive a single summary message with status and the tail of output.

Returns immediately with a task_id. To wait for the command to finish and get the final output in the same turn, call `monitor_wait` with that task_id.

Use when:
- The user wants to run a long-running command (build, test, ping, log tail) and react to the result.
- There is no fixed schedule — work happens whenever output appears.

Don't use when:
- The user wants something to happen on a fixed schedule (every minute, daily at 9am) — use cron_create.
- The user wants model-paced retries until a condition is met — use the loop tool.

The command runs until it exits naturally or you call `monitor_stop`.

USEFUL PATTERNS (compose monitor_start with the right command for the trigger you want):

**File-watch** — fire when a file or directory changes (works while ata is open):
- macOS: `monitor_start command="fswatch /path/to/file"` then `monitor_watch_for pattern=".*"`. Needs `brew install fswatch`.
- Linux: `monitor_start command="inotifywait -m -e modify /path/to/file"` then `monitor_watch_for pattern="MODIFY"`. Needs `apt install inotify-tools`.
Each file change emits one line; `monitor_watch_for` wakes the agent on the match.

**Receive a webhook / one-way HTTP signal** — listen on a localhost port (works while ata is open):
- `monitor_start command="ncat -l 8765 --keep-open"` then `monitor_watch_for pattern="^POST"`. Needs `ncat` (from nmap).
- Caveats: no HTTP response is sent back to the caller (connection just closes); no path routing; no header parsing. Fine for simple "ping me when X happens" hooks, not for production integrations.

NOTE on persistence: monitor (and these patterns) only fire while ata is open. For schedules that must survive ata closing, the only available tool is `cron_create` (OS cron). There is no persistent file-watch or webhook tool today."#

        description: r#"Block until a running monitor emits a line containing `pattern`, or until the subprocess terminates without ever matching, or until an explicit `timeout_seconds` fires. Lighter than `monitor_wait` when the caller only cares about a specific event (a phase boundary, an error keyword, a "ready" signal) rather than the final result.

By default this waits indefinitely and returns on the FIRST matching line. Matching is a literal substring on the raw line payload (not the `[stdout]` / `[stderr]` tag).

Batch mode: pass `all_matches=true` to collect EVERY matching line over the lifetime of the subprocess (or until `max_matches` / `timeout_seconds`). Used for "react to each item in a batch" workflows — every paper processed, every test that fails, every download that completes.

Returns: {
  matched: bool,
  matching_line: string | null,        # first match (single-match mode, or convenience first-match in batch mode)
  stream: "stdout" | "stderr" | null,  # only set when at least one match
  matches: [{ matching_line, stream }] # populated only when all_matches=true, contains every match in order
  terminated_without_match: bool,
  timed_out: bool
}.

Use when:
- The user asked you to react to a *specific* phrase in the output ("tell me when the build prints 'warning:'", "alert me when the server says 'listening on port'", "wait for 'PANIC' to appear").
- You want to act mid-stream without waiting for the full subprocess to finish.
- The user is processing a batch and wants per-item feedback ("tell me as each paper downloads", "as each test fails, list it") — pass `all_matches=true`.

Don't use when:
- The user wants the *final result* of the command, including exit status — use `monitor_wait` instead.
- The user wants to keep watching forever — just call `monitor_start` with `background=false` and let the per-line stream render in chat."#

By default this call waits indefinitely — there is no internal time cap. The function sits in a cheap polling loop against an in-memory registry, costs no LLM tokens while waiting, and returns the instant the subprocess actually exits. Set `timeout_seconds` only when the caller explicitly wants a bounded wait.

Returns: { status: "Completed" | "Failed" | "Killed" | "Running" (only if an explicit timeout fires), tail: [string] }.

Use when:
- You started a monitor and want to use its output in the same response (e.g. report the result, summarize errors).
- The user asked for a result that depends on a command finishing.
